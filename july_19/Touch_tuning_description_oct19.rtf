\f0\fs24 \cf0 Touch-tuned cells were determined by computing touch-triggered average activity for each cell, before calculating whether the data distribution of peak touch-induced activity exceeds the expected activity of shuffled data. In more detail, the time of first touch - between the mouse's whisker and the metal pole - on each trial was recorded. For each touch time, one second of activity (seven data samples) was extracted before and after the frame closest to touch (15 frames total); taking the mean touch-triggered activity across touches gave the average touch response for the cell. To determine whether a cell was touch tuned or not the peak mean-touch-triggered average activity was calculated. This peak touch-triggered-mean was compared to equivalently computed peak mean activity for 10000 matched (to the number of touches), randomly sampled 15 frame segments. The rank of the empirical mean among the 10000 randomly sampled means returns a a p-value for the touch triggered activity. A cell was considered touch tuned if this empirical p-value was below 0.05 (Benjamini Hochberg corrected).\
