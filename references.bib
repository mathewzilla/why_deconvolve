                   recording of responses of hundreds of neurons over hours and
                   even days, but provides a relatively indirect measure of
                   their spiking activity. Existing deconvolution algorithms
                   attempt to recover spikes from observed imaging data, which
                   are then commonly subjected to the same analyses that are
                   applied to electrophysiologically recorded spikes (e.g.,
                   estimation of average firing rates, or tuning curves). Here
                   we show, however, that in the presence of noise this
                   approach is often heavily biased. We propose an alternative
                   analysis that aims to estimate the underlying rate directly,
                   by integrating over the unobserved spikes instead of
                   committing to a single estimate of the spike train. This
                   approach can be used to estimate average firing rates or
                   tuning curves directly from the imaging data, and is
                   sufficiently flexible to incorporate prior knowledge about
                   tuning structure. We show that directly estimated rates are
                   more accurate than those obtained from averaging of spikes
                   estimated through deconvolution, both on simulated data and
                   on imaging data acquired in mouse visual cortex.",

               when it is limited to functionally coherent areas.

               comparatively small neural ensembles, even when modern-day
               techniques are used. Here we review results which have started
               to fill the gap between these two scales of inquiry, by shedding
               light on the statistical distributions of activity in large
               populations of cells. We put our main focus on data recorded in
               awake animals that perform simple decision-making tasks and
               consider statistical distributions of activity throughout
               cortex, across sensory, associative, and motor areas. We
               transversally review the complexity of these distributions, from
               distributions of firing rates and metrics of spike-train
               structure, through distributions of tuning to stimuli or actions
               and of choice signals, and finally the dynamical evolution of
               neural population activity and the distributions of (pairwise)
               neural interactions. This approach reveals shared patterns of
               statistical organization across cortex, including: (i)
               long-tailed distributions of activity, where quasi-silence seems
               to be the rule for a majority of neurons; that are barely
               distinguishable between spontaneous and active states; (ii)
               distributions of tuning parameters for sensory (and motor)
               variables, which show an extensive extrapolation and
               fragmentation of their representations in the periphery; and
               (iii) population-wide dynamics that reveal rotations of internal
               representations over time, whose traces can be found both in
               stimulus-driven and internally generated activity. We discuss
               how these insights are leading us away from the notion of
               discrete classes of cells, and are acting as powerful

  abstract = "Calcium imaging is a powerful method to record the activity of
              neural populations in many species, but inferring spike times
              from calcium signals is a challenging problem. We compared
              multiple approaches using multiple datasets with ground truth
              electrophysiology, and found that simple non-negative
              deconvolution (NND) outperformed all other algorithms on
              out-of-sample test data. We introduce a novel benchmark
              applicable to recordings without electrophysiological ground
              truth, based on the correlation of responses to two stimulus
              repeats, and used this to show that unconstrained NND also

              datasets of ∼10,000 cell recordings from the visual cortex of
              mice of either sex. Finally, we show that NND-based methods match

              neural networks, while avoiding some of the biases of such
              methods, and at much faster running times. We therefore recommend
              that spikes be inferred from calcium traces using simple NND, due

              STATEMENTThe experimental method that currently allows for
              recordings of the largest numbers of cells simultaneously is
              two-photon calcium imaging. However, use of this powerful method
              requires that neuronal firing times be inferred correctly from
              the large resulting datasets. Previous studies have claimed that
              complex supervised learning algorithms outperform simple
              deconvolution methods at this task. Unfortunately, these studies
              suffered from several problems and biases. When we repeated the
              analysis, using the same data and correcting these problems, we
              found that simpler spike inference methods perform better. Even
              more importantly, we found that supervised learning methods can
              introduce artifactual structure into spike trains, that can in
              turn lead to erroneous scientific conclusions. Of the algorithms
              we evaluated, we found that an extremely simple method performed
              best in all circumstances tested, was much faster to run, and was
              insensitive to parameter choices, making incorrect scientific
              conclusions much less likely.",

  abstract      = "In recent years, new technologies in neuroscience have made
                   it possible to measure the activities of large numbers of
                   neurons in behaving animals. For each neuron, a fluorescence
                   trace is measured; this can be seen as a first-order
                   approximation of the neuron's activity over time.
                   Determining the exact time at which a neuron spikes on the
                   basis of its fluorescence trace is an important open problem
                   in the field of computational neuroscience. Recently, a
                   convex optimization problem involving an $\ell_1$ penalty
                   was proposed for this task. In this paper, we slightly
                   modify that recent proposal by replacing the $\ell_1$
                   penalty with an $\ell_0$ penalty. In stark contrast to the
                   conventional wisdom that $\ell_0$ optimization problems are
                   computationally intractable, we show that the resulting
                   optimization problem can be efficiently solved for the
                   global optimum using an extremely simple and efficient
                   dynamic programming algorithm. Our R-language implementation
                   of the proposed algorithm runs in a few minutes on
                   fluorescence traces of $100,000$ timesteps. Furthermore, our
                   proposal leads to substantially better results than the
                   previous $\ell_1$ proposal, on synthetic data as well as on

               to transient presentation of texture and grating patterns at 25
               sites within the parafoveal representation of V1, V2, and V3 of
               two awake monkeys trained to perform a fixation task. In grating
               experiments, stimuli varied in orientation, spatial frequency,
               or both. In texture experiments, stimuli varied in contrast,
               check size, texture type, or pairs of these attributes. 2. To
               examine the nature and precision of temporal coding, we compared
               individual responses elicited by each set of stimuli in terms of
               two families of metrics. One family of metrics, D(spike), was
               sensitive to the absolute spike time (following stimulus onset).
               The second family of metrics, D(interval), was sensitive to the
               pattern of interspike intervals. In each family, the metrics
               depend on a parameter q, which expresses the precision of
               temporal coding. For q = 0, both metrics collapse into the
               ``spike count'' metric D(Count), which is sensitive to the
               number of impulses but insensitive to their position in time. 3.
               Each of these metrics, with values of q ranging from 0 to 512/s,
               was used to calculate the distance between all pairs of spike
               trains within each dataset. The extent of stimulus-specific
               clustering manifest in these pairwise distances was quantified
               by an information measure. Chance clustering was estimated by
               applying the same procedure to synthetic data sets in which
               responses were assigned randomly to the input stimuli. 4. Of the
               352 data sets, 170 showed evidence of tuning via the spike count
               (q = 0) metric, 294 showed evidence of tuning via the spike time
               metric, 272 showed evidence of tuning via the spike interval
               metric to the stimulus attribute (contrast, check size,
               orientation, spatial frequency, or texture type) under study.
               Across the entire dataset, the information not attributable to
               chance clustering averaged 0.042 bits for the spike count
               metric, 0.171 bits for the optimal spike time metric, and 0.107
               bits for the optimal spike interval metric. 5. The reciprocal of
               the optimal cost q serves as a measure of the temporal precision
               of temporal coding. In V1 and V2, with both metrics, temporal
               precision was highest for contrast (ca. 10-30 ms) and lowest for
               texture type (ca. 100 ms). This systematic dependence of q on
               stimulus attribute provides a possible mechanism for the
               simultaneous representation of multiple stimulus attributes in
               one spike train. 6. Our findings are inconsistent with Poisson
               models of spike trains. Synthetic data sets in which firing rate
               was governed by a time-dependent Poisson process matched to the
               observed poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) overestimated
               clustering induced by D(count) and, for low values of q,
               D(spike)[q] and D(intervals)[q]. Synthetic data sets constructed
               from a modified Poisson process, which preserved not only the
               PSTH but also spike count statistics accounted for the
               clustering induced by D(count) but underestimated the clustering
               induced by D(spike)[q] and D(interval)[q].",

  abstract = "In recent years, the development of algorithms to detect neuronal
              spiking activity from two-photon calcium imaging data has
              received much attention. Meanwhile, few researchers have examined
              the metrics used to assess the similarity of detected spike
              trains with the ground truth. We highlight the limitations of the
              two most commonly used metrics, the spike train correlation and
              success rate, and propose an alternative, which we refer to as
              CosMIC. Rather than operating on the true and estimated spike
              trains directly, the proposed metric assesses the similarity of
              the pulse trains obtained from convolution of the spike trains
              with a smoothing pulse. The pulse width, which is derived from
              the statistics of the imaging data, reflects the temporal
              tolerance of the metric. The final metric score is the size of
              the commonalities of the pulse trains as a fraction of their
              average size. Viewed through the lens of set theory, CosMIC
              resembles a continuous Sorensen-Dice coefficient - an index
              commonly used to assess the similarity of discrete,
              presence/absence data. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed
              metric to discriminate the precision and recall of spike train
              estimates. Unlike the spike train correlation, which appears to
              reward overfitting, the proposed metric score is maximised when
              the correct number of spikes have been detected. Furthermore, we
              show that CosMIC discriminates the temporal precision of
              estimates more consistently than either the success rate or the
              spike train correlation.",

              however, these patterns lie in a space of lower dimension, as if
              individual neurons were ``obedient members of a huge orchestra''.
              Here we use recordings from the visual cortex of mouse (Mus
              musculus) and monkey (Macaca mulatta) to investigate the
              relationship between individual neurons and the population, and
              to establish the underlying circuit mechanisms. We show that
              neighbouring neurons can differ in their coupling to the overall
              firing of the population, ranging from strongly coupled
              'choristers' to weakly coupled 'soloists'. Population coupling is
              largely independent of sensory preferences, and it is a fixed
              cellular attribute, invariant to stimulus conditions. Neurons
              with high population coupling are more strongly affected by
              non-sensory behavioural variables such as motor intention.
              Population coupling reflects a causal relationship, predicting
              the response of a neuron to optogenetically driven increases in
              local activity. Moreover, population coupling indicates synaptic
              connectivity; the population coupling of a neuron, measured in
              vivo, predicted subsequent in vitro estimates of the number of
              synapses received from its neighbours. Finally, population
              coupling provides a compact summary of population activity;
              knowledge of the population couplings of n neurons predicts a
              substantial portion of their n(2) pairwise correlations.
              Population coupling therefore represents a novel, simple measure
              that characterizes the relationship of each neuron to a larger
              population, explaining seemingly complex network firing patterns
